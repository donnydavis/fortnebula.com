So Donny is at it again, making new sites for no real reason. 

Well there was a good reason for this site being done all over yet again. 

I was trying to get an easy way to place code snippets into wordpress, and even though I am sure this is easy it isn't clean.

I wasn't happy with the speed of my wordpress site either. So I moved to jekyll, and host it on github.

The learning curve for someone who is new to this kind of web was fairly steep, or maybe I am just not that bright. 

Anyways I think the new site looks great, and runs even better.
