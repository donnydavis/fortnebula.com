If you check out the Documents section of Fort Nebula, you will see a pretty slick document management system at work. It's  [asciibinder](http://www.asciibinder.org/index.html), and is used around the web for documentation generation. It's asciidoctor based, and you can apply any sort of customization you would like. If you are interested, you can check it out here on [Fort Nebula](http://project.fortnebula.com/docs/latest/welcome/)
